\textsc{2020--2023} & \textbf{Devops Engineer} at \emph{Robert Bosch}, Remote \\
& \footnotesize{Worked on the \emph{KPI Framework} project which visualizes data obtained from GitHub and BitBucket in Grafana. Fixed issues in the application (Python), in the infrastructure code (Ansible, Kubernetes, docker-compose) and around CI/CD (Jenkins). Took part in redesigning the architecture to run the service as functions on Azure Cloud.

\emph{DroneTruth Project}:
\begin{itemize}\footnotesize{
\item Developed a self-service Python CLI tool using the Azure SDK that enabled developers to manage their own GPU-based cloud environments, reducing manual setup time.
\item Deployed machine learning applications to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Kubernetes, Helm, and FluxCD for GitOps-based continuous delivery.
\item Managed and automated ML pipelines with Azure DevOps and provisioned infrastructure with Terraform.
\item
}\end{itemize}
Worked on the \emph{DroneTruth} project which uses machine learning to generate ground truth for autonomous driving software based on drone camera recordings. Used \emph{Azure DevOps} to run machine learning pipelines. Used \emph{Terraform} for managing cloud based GPU development environments. Created a Python CLI application utilising the Azure SDK to make the management of development environments self-service. Used \emph{Kubernetes} and \emph{Helm} with \emph{Flux2} to deploy applications on \emph{Azure Kubernetes Service}.
